**Connecting talent with opportunity.**

Growing up in a remote village in Rwanda where most children lack the ability to attend established education institutions, I saw the imbalance between capability and access to opportunity first-hand. In response, I developed ‘WeShare’, an online networking site to enable students to find higher education opportunities in my country. Despite its initial challenges, such as a lack of depth of understanding of web platforms and inadequate resources to stress test the platform, I am determined to resume the project and develop it further. With newfound knowledge and experience, I am eager to overcome the obstacles that hindered the project in its early stages. My goal is to enhance the functionality of 'WeShare' and expand its reach, ensuring that more students in Rwanda can access valuable educational opportunities and achieve their full potential. By investing time and effort into this endeavor, I hope to bridge the gap between capability and access, empowering the youth in my country to pursue their dreams and contribute to a brighter future for all.
